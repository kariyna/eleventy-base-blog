# About

Originally, I hadn't planned on starting a blog. I was content with just my <a href="https://writings.howsoonisnow.org/digitalgarden/" target="_blank">digital garden</a>, but I realised I didn't want to mix long-form writing with the garden's more chaotic nature. I also underestimated how much I would eventually want a separate space where I could really ramble at length.

The header of my blog is inspired by a cyberculture magazine from the 1990s, <i>Mondo 2000</i>. I find the aesthetic of this publication so captivating and ahead of its time.
